#EDC
 If subjects are **pre-natal**, use the **Estimated Date of Confinement** (EDC) features (i.e. due date) instead of Date of Birth.  This should enabled within the Configuration module in two places: first under the Study variables section set "Use EDC" to true for the entire Loris database, and second, "Use EDC" should be enabled in the subproject settings for each applicable subproject.
